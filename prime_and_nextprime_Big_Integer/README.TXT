There are in-built functions of isProbablePrime() which returns a boolean value and nextProbablePrime() which returns the next Proabable integer of the entered value. These in-built functions are present in BigInteger class which is a part of Math package. This code takes integer input from the user and prints whether the entered number is a prime or not and also prints the next probable integer value.
