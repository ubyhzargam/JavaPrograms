It's not possible to calculate factorials of large numbers by using int data type. So to calculate Factorial of larger numbers like 50 or 100,
we use BigInteger class. BigInteger class helps us to operate on very large integer values, for example say 1000 factorial. It is a huge 
number, but you can get the result of that by running the above code and input the value 1000. The code will print 1000! for you....
