This code takes 4 inputs from the user : n,a,b and c. This solves a rope cutting problem, it considers a rope of length n and returns the maximum number of cuts possible such that the remaining elements of the rope are equal to either a,b or c. If there is no possibility of the above mentioned then it returns -1. This is implemented using recursion
